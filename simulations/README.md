Results from running `StashSizeSimulator`, with its output captured in the CSV files (when run with a particular bucket size given in the filename). Each CSV file notes how often the stash size (root bucket size) reached a certain number (with the entry at -1 being the number of access measured). The plot graphs a given stash size against the inverse log2 of [number of that stash size was exceeded]/[total number of accesses at which stash size is measured]. Each line is approximately straight, supporting the paper's argument that the overflow probability decreases exponentially as the allotted stash size (root bucket size) increases.
